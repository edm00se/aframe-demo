# aframe demo

A demo of the simplicity of a basic 360 degree image implemented via aframe. More likely to come, but you're probably not interested since it's a bunch of riffs on [aframe's examples](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/examples).

## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/edm00se/aframe-demo.git`
- `cd aframe-demo`
- `npm install`

## Usage

- `npm run build` to update any JavaScript, should not be needed
- `npm run dev` to run a local server
- host elsewhere, it's a static site
